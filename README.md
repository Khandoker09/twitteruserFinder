# twitteruserFinder
Its a simple tools to manage twitter query in a excel file. using Twitter developer api, tweepy and tkinter this whole script was written. Because its uses twitter developer 
api it can only scrape upto 1000 users informations.using tkinter i have made a very simple user interface so that any no tech background people who does not know how to write
a code can also work with this script.

### Advantages:

- Can search anything in any language
### Disadvantages:
- User interface does not have a quite buttons 
- Scrape only upto 1000 users 
- this tool is little bit slow in time to time 
- Generates only .csv file 
- Dependent on the tweepy
