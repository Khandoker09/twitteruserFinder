# twitteruserFinder
Its a simple tool to manage twitter query in a excel file. using Twitter developer api, tweepy and tkinter this whole script was written. Because its uses twitter developer 
api it can only scrape upto 1000 users informations.Using tkinter i have made a very simple user interface so that anyone with no tech background can also able to use this script.

### Advantages:
- Using pyinstaller one can easily build a windows executable file in .exe format
- Using simple graphical user interface using tkinter 
- Can search anything in any language
- Extract users first and last name and job title(no all the cases) 
### Disadvantages:
- User interface does not have a quite buttons 
- Scrape only upto 1000 users 
- this tool is little bit slow in time to time 
- Generates only .csv file 
- Dependent on the tweepy
